poll is standardized in POSIX, so is more portable across different unix like operating systems.
epoll is specific to linux.

epoll is more complex, it requires creating an epoll instance,
you need to manage the fd's lifecycle and handle events through a separate event structure
whereas poll doesnt require the creating of an instance and you dont have to manage a separate event structure

poll is older, so more info, more examples etc.

poll interates through all its fd's, so it is inefficient for applications with a large number of connections
epoll can handle more fd's more efficient, so is better for large scale webservers.

poll will recreate an array of the fd's everytime its used, so there is more memory usage
epoll uses an instance, so it doesnt need to recreate the array.


poll is easier, and works fine if you dont have that many fd's.
poll is also portable across Unix like operating systems, epoll is not.
epoll is more scalable, but also a bit more complex.
